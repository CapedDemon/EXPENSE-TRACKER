Expense Tracker is a very good tool to keep track of your expenseditures and the total money you saved.🤑🤑

We at some point of our life have kept track of our expenses and the money saved. 📃 We all have used the traditional way of keeping our 
record by writing our expenses in our **personal diary** 📃 which can be burnt out, the papers might cut into pieces ✂ or the 📜 diary
got so old 🗑 that we need to write our expenses in another diary.🖋🖋 It is very time consuming also.⏳⌚

*But it is the most safe way of keeping record. But the time has changed laptops and mobiles are takng over. Most of the time we are spending on computers only.*
